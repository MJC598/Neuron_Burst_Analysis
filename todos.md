## Overview Neural Networks in Time Series (Done)
#### What we can contribute?
#### What is useful for what?
#### Limitations for each:
    * VAEs
    * RNNs (LSTMs, GRUs, etc)
    * CNNs
#### Use for dynamical systems?
#### XAI

## Analyize RippleNet and Deep Interpolation (Done)

## One Pagers
* Graphs of predictions using filtered input and filtered output
    * White noise test in models (as check)
* Graphs of predictions using raw input and raw output
    * White noise test in models (as check)
* Graphs of predictions using raw input and filtered output
    * White noise test in models (as check)
* Plot loss surfaces
* Test more values
* Find maxes .5 of R2 (rough benchmarking)


## SBI
* What is LFP?

## Dynamical Systems
* TODO on box
* python controls library [here](https://python-control.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.0/)
* [Discretizer](https://python-control.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.0/generated/control.matlab.c2d.html)
* MATLAB uses [zero-order hold](https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/sldiscmdl.html) on inputs
